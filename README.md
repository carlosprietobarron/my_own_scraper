## Game Rules

- The board for this game is a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- The first player is X, the second player is O. Players take turns putting their marks in unmarked (numbered) squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Game flow

1. Each player is asked for their name.
2. The board is displayed before each player marks a cell, so they can see the current game status.
3. Players take turns to mark a cell that is available by entering the number of the cell.
4. The game checks if there is a winner or a tie after each turn.
